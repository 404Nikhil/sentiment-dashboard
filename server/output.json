It shows a giant red nebula and its smaller blue neighbor, which are both part of a vast star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located 163,000 light-years away. In this picture, we can see how young, energetic, massive stars illuminate and sculpt their birthplace with powerful winds and searing ultraviolet radiation.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nAt the heart of the big red nebula are sparkling stars, each of which are 10 to 20 times more massive than our Sun. The stars' ultraviolet radiation heats the surrounding dense gas. The massive stars also unleash fierce winds of charged particles that blast away lower-density gas, forming the bubble-like structures seen on the right, which resemble coral.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nBy contrast, the seemingly isolated blue nebula at lower left was created by a solitary mammoth star 200,000 times brighter than our Sun. The blue gas was ejected by the star through a series of eruptive events during which it lost part of its outer envelope of material.‚Å£\n ‚Å£\nImage description: An image is split in two. In the bottom left of the first image a bright blue ring appears, slightly fading in all directions, with a small blue dot in the middle. Red and orange waves of gas ripple, arcing from top left to top right. A light blue center appears out of the sea of red, and several bright white dots shine through. In the top right, dark blue gas emanates from the blackness of space.‚Å£\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, STScI‚Å£\n ‚Å£\n#NASA #Hubble #CoralReef #Nebula #Stars #Astronomy",

Earth‚Äôs atmosphere ‚Äì seen as layers of orange, white, and blue ‚Äì acts like a lens, bending light that passes through it and toward the astronaut‚Äôs camera. \n \nAs that light passed through Earth‚Äôs upper atmosphere, it hit ice crystals that form when water vapor freezes onto tiny dust particles. These ice crystals bent, or refracted, the light, forming an arc that looks like a halo by the Moon!\n \nThrough NASA‚Äôs Artemis campaign, we‚Äôre learning more about our Moon than ever before. Next up is Artemis II, which will send a human crew to orbit the Moon for the first time in over 50 years.

Near the center is New York City, with the distinctive shape of Long Island trailing off to the right. Newark and New Jersey sit across the river to the left; Philadelphia is in the bottom-left corner and Hartford, CT is in the top-right. Interstate 95, which connects many of the cities in this image, is visible here as a thin bright line. (Check the coast of Connecticut if you don't see it at first.) \n\nAstronaut photos taken from the space station aren't just pretty pictures: they provide a unique perspective of our changing Earth, especially for hazards and natural disasters. And Earth isn't the only world they're studying‚Äîwhen Artemis II lifts off in early 2026, our four-member crew will capture pictures of the Moon as it's never been seen before.\n\nImage description: The bright lights of New England and the mid-Atlantic shine in this image taken from the International Space Station.

      "caption": "She‚Äôs different, but shines in her own way üåû\n \nIn this photo of Uranus captured by @NASAHubble, its auroras are on full display. But unlike other members of the Solar System, the pair of auroras shine on Uranus‚Äôs left and right sides instead of at the top and bottom of the planet.\n \nThis is because of how the magnetic poles of Uranus are oriented. Most planets in our Solar System ‚Äì like Earth ‚Äì have magnetic poles on opposite vertical ends of the planet, with some tilting slightly to the side. Uranus, however, is the maverick of the planetary family. Its magnetic poles sit on opposite horizontal ends of the planet, as if the planet was lying on its side.\n \nAuroras happen when energetic particles from the Sun collide with a planet‚Äôs magnetic shield, transferring their energy to particles in the planet‚Äôs atmosphere. When that built-up energy is released, it creates a light show emanating from the magnetic poles. Since Uranus has horizontal poles rather than vertical, its auroras appear on the left and right sides of the planet.\n \nImage description: The sky blue planet of Uranus is centered against black space, glowing with deep blue auroras on its right and left sides. One of its rings is visible as a faint, white circle around the planet.\n \nCredit: ESA/Hubble, NASA, L. Lamy, L. Sromovsky\n \n#NASA #ESA #Uranus #Aurora #Planets #SolarSystem",

We'll let you decide\n\n@NASAWebb recently took a look at the Sagittarius B2 molecular cloud: the most massive, and active star-forming region in our galaxy, located only a few hundred light years from the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole. Astronomers want to figure out why this cloud is so much more active than the rest of the galactic center. While Sgr B2 has only 10% of the galactic center's gas, it produces 50% of its stars. \n\nEven with Webb's sensitive infrared capability, which allows it to see through clouds of dust and gas, there are regions so dense that our orbiting telescope can't see through them. These thick clouds are the raw material of future stars‚Äîand a cocoon for those still too young to shine.\n\nThe first three slides in this carousel show Sgr B2 as seen by Webb's Mid-Infrared Instrument, which captured glowing cosmic dust heated by very young massive stars in unprecedented detail. Note that while the dust and gas glow dramatically, all the bright stars disappear from view. In contrast, in near-infrared wavelengths (seen in the last three images), it's the colorful stars that steal the show. Astronomers will seek to discover the masses and ages of these stars to better learn about how they're formed in this dense, active region of the galactic center. \n\nRead more at the link in @NASAWebb's bio.\n\nImage credit: Image: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Adam Ginsburg (University of Florida), Nazar Budaiev (University of Florida), Taehwa Yoo (University of Florida); Image Processing: Alyssa Pagan (STScI)\n\nImage description: Two images of space, each split up into three slides. The first three slides depict a swirling patch of red and magenta clouds, with bright blue, six-pointed spots shining through. In the second three slides, the same image is seen in shades of orange, but the stars are much more numerous, filling the screen almost completely.\n\n#NASA #Space #Universe #JWST #Astrophotography",

We're fortunate, from the viewpoint of our solar system, that the Phantom Galaxy appears face-on, allowing us to study its intricate spiral arms in great detail.\n\nThe Phantom Galaxy is 32 million light-years away, and can be found in the constellation Pisces. Visit webb.nasa.gov to check out the latest updates from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nImage description: An intricate net of spiral arms, in shades of red and orange, swirls towards a small, bright blue center.
